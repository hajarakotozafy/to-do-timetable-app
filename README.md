# To-Do Timetable App 📅✅

## Description

I learned the basics of Vue.js 🌱 and state management with this framework by developing this small application 📱 that combines a to-do app 📝 and a timetable 📅. It's a slightly unconventional idea 💡, but the goal was successfully achieved 🎯.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js 🟩
- Pinia 🍍

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks 📝
- Schedule events in a timetable 📅
- Keep track of your productivity ✅
